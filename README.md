# EyeTracking
Eye Tracking User Interface with Tensorflow Deep Learning
*Note:* This project is still under development, and will generally only work with head tilts, not eye movement, due to the images being resized for computational complexity. GPU configuration is needed.
## Stages in Tkinter
### Stage 0: Starting Page
Choose whether to add data to the column or row training data
### Stage 1: Picture Taking Stage
Add training data by looking at a bar go back and forth. As it goes back and forth, the program takes pictures of where you are looking
### Stage 2: Training Stage
The model is being trained (may take a while)
### Stage 4: Eye Tracking Stage
Where you look will be predicted by the model
